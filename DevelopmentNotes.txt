Tile game

To do--------------------------------------------
-revamp graphics
	--render size and info
	--sprites
	--remove border
		---first add keypress to exit game

-alter movement control system to mouse/click based
	--consider using a velocity factor to smooth out movement(play and 
		camera movement speed up and slow down instead of suddenly jerking into motion)
		
-research entity component system and possibly implement

-fix collision to use second layer of tiles rather than 'walkable'
	variable or employ "walkable" to second layer

-change map loading to pull data from a configuration file for that map

-create an event class that can effect the game world

-create an eventScript class to read scripted events from a file and 
	call the event class to fire the events

-renaming class types
	--decoration: seen but no interaction; debris, flowers, etc
	--props: decorations with interaction; boxes, boulders, pipes, etc
	--zones: invisible with interaction; script triggers, etc

GamePlayConcepts--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Enemies fleeing
	--enemies(intelligent) too far below the player run rather than 	 	fighting
	--set of enemies who do not fight, but always flee
		---when killed yield small amount of resources in case player
			 is in a bad position and needs some at little risk
		---may lead to interesting side locations or caches of 
			items
